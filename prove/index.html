		<h1>Proof Checker</h1>
		<p>I worked with Dr. Martin Strauss, Elizabeth Viera, and Dr. Gavin La
			Rose to build a simple web interface that could be used to
			automatically check simple proofs.
		<p>The prototype was built in JavaScript. It has a
			<a href="https://github.com/CurtisFenner/Proof-Drilling">GitHub
			repository available here</a>.

		<h2>Proof Structure</h2>
		<p>A proof is a sequence of statements that have
			justifications.
		<p>A <em>statement</em> is some (boolean) expression asserting some
			fact.
		<p>A <em>justification</em> is the reason it is valid to write a
			particular statement. Examples include
		<ul>
			<li><em>given</em>: the statement is part of the hypothesis
			<li><em>reflexivity of '='</em>: the statement follows from some
				basic, universal property
			<li><em>modus ponens</em>: the statement follows from several
				previous statements and a deduction rule / theorem
			<li><em>subproof</em>: the statement does not necessarily follow
				from previous statements, <em>but</em> it is a valid starting
				point to prove some lemma. For example, a contradiction subproof
				begins by supposing something that is thought to be false.<br>
				It ends by concluding the complement of what was supposed, if
				a contradiction has been reached.
		</ul>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h2>Proof Verification</h2>
		<p>A proof is verified by validating a number of things.
		<ul>
			<li>The statements are well-formed. For example, "for all"
				statements must use a single name as their variable (as opposed
				to an expression)
			<li>The justifications refer only to in-scope statements 'in-scope'.
				To be in-scope, a statement must appear before the current
				statement, and not be in a closed subproof.
			<li>The proof has closed all subproofs.
			<li>The justification of every statement is correct
			<li>The thing that was supposed to be proved was proved
		</ul>
		<p>Because these checks are all done separately, it's possible to
			give a detailed responses to partially correct / partially
			complete proofs.

		<h2>Justification Verification (an example)</h2>
		<p>Justifications are mostly verified by matching the student's
			statement and the previous statements against different statement
			structures.
		<p>Consider this simple proof involving Universal Elimination
		<table>
			<tr><th>#<th>Statement<th>Justification
			<tr><td><span class=box>1</span><td>&forall;x, Q(x + 1)<td>Given
			<tr><td><span class=box>2</span><td>Q(cos(5) + 1)<td>Universal Elimination of <span class=box>1</span>
		</table>
		<p>The justification "Universal Elimination of
			<span class=box>1</span> resulting in <span class=box>2</span>"
			needs to be checked.
		<p>First, the statements are parsed and turned into trees of operations.

		<figure class=inline>
			<figcaption>Statement <span class=box>1</span></figcaption>
			<ol class=tree>
				<li>&forall;
				<ol>
					<li>x
					<li>$
					<ol>
						<li>Q
						<li>+
						<ol>
							<li>x
							<li>1
						</ol>
					</ol>
				</ol>
			</ol>
		</figure>
		<figure class=inline>
			<figcaption>Statement <span class=box>2</span></figcaption>
			<ol class=tree>
				<li>$
				<ol>
					<li>Q
					<li>+
					<ol>
						<li>$
						<ol>
							<li>cos
							<li>5
						</ol>
						<li>1
					</ol>
				</ol>
			</ol>
		</figure>

		<p>Statement <span class=box>2</span> is matched against a small tree to
			verify that it is a for-all statement.
		<ol class=tree>
			<li>&forall;
			<ol>
				<li><span class=bubble>var</span>
				<li><span class=bubble>pred</span>
			</ol>
		</ol>
		<p>When this match succeeds, we get the assignments
		<ul>
			<li><span class=bubble>var</span> is x
			<li><span class=bubble>pred</span> is Q(x + 1)
		</ul>

		<p>Next, <span class=bubble>var</span> is subsituted with a hole
			<span class=bubble>instance</span> in
			<span class=bubble>pred</span>, yielding the tree
		<ol class=tree>
			<li>$
			<ol>
				<li>Q
				<ol>
					<li>+
					<ol>
						<li><span class=bubble>inst</span>
						<li>1
					</ol>
				</ol>
			</ol>
		</ol>
		<p>The students answer is matched against this, successfully yielding
			the assignment
		<ul>
			<li><span class=bubble>inst</span> is cos(5)
		</ul>
		<p>Thus, the justification was valid and the statement is justified.
