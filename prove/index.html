		<h1>Proof Checker</h1>
		<p>I worked with Dr. Martin Strauss, Elizabeth Viera, and Dr. Gavin La
			Rose to build a simple web interface that could be used to
			automatically check simple proofs as a teaching tool.
		<p>A prototype was first built in JavaScript. It has a
			<a href="https://github.com/CurtisFenner/Proof-Drilling">GitHub
			repository available here</a>.
		<p>A partial implementation for WeBWorK (an open-source online math
			homework platform)
			<a href="https://github.com/CurtisFenner/ProofCheckerWeBWorK">has a
			GitHub repository here</a>. The development WeBWorK course is
			<ahref="https://itcdevel.math.lsa.umich.edu/webwork2/mathlogic/cw/1/">here</a>.

		<h2>Proof Structure</h2>
		<p>In this project, a proof is a sequence of statements that have
			justifications.
		<p>A <em>statement</em> is some (boolean) expression asserting some
			fact. Examples of statements include
			<ul>
				<li> &forall;x P(x)
				<li> x = f(y)
				<li> P(a, b) &and; P(b, a)
			</ul>
		<p>A <em>justification</em> is the reason it is valid to write a
			particular statement. Examples include
		<ul>
			<li><em>given</em>: the statement is given as true as part of the
				exercise.
			<li><em>reflexivity of '='</em>: the statement follows from some
				basic, universal property
			<li><em>modus ponens</em>: the statement follows from a basic
				deduction rule, such as modus ponens
			<li><em>subproof</em>: the statement does not necessarily follow
				from previous statements, <em>but</em> it is a valid starting
				point to prove some lemma. For example, a contradiction subproof
				begins by supposing something that is thought to be false.<br>
				It ends by concluding the complement of what was supposed, once
				a contradiction has been reached.<br>
				See a full description in the <em>Subproofs</em> section.
		</ul>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Proof Verification</h2>
		<p>A proof is verified by validating a number of things.
		<ul>
			<li>The statements are well-formed and do not violate any of the
				rules of any of the operations used
			<li>The justifications refer only to in-scope statements.
				To be in-scope, a statement must appear before the current
				statement, and not be in a closed subproof.
			<li>The proof has closed all subproofs.
			<li>The justification of every statement is correct. (This depends
				on the rule being used; see the next section for an in-depth
				example)
			<li>The thing that was supposed to be proved was proved
		</ul>
		<p>Because these checks are all done separately, it's possible to
			give detailed responses to partially correct / partially
			complete proofs.
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Subproofs</h2>
		<p>This project uses a system called <em>Natural Deduction</em>. Proofs
			are
			sequences of <em>statements</em> and <em>subproofs</em>. Statements
			are justified given previous in-scope statements.
		<p><em>Subproofs</em> are sequences of statements that begin by
			supposing some statement is true. Depending on the kind of subproof,
			different statements may be supposed.
		<p>Statements inside a sub-proof are <em>scoped</em> to that subproof
			(in a way similar to lexical scoping in programming language).
			The statement is no longer in-scope after the subproof ends, and
			cannot be referenced by any further justifications.
		<p>When a subproof ends, it concludes with a single statement that is
			in-scope
			for the remainder of the proof. The <em>conclusion</em> that is
			allowed depends on the type of subproof that was opened.
		<p>For example, this is what a <b>Contradiction subproof</b> looks like.
		<table>
			<tr><th>#<th>Statement<th>Justification
			<tr><td>1 <td>&forall;x, P(x) &rArr; Q(x) <td>Given
			<tr><td>2 <td>&not;Q(5) <td>Given
			<tr><td>3 <td>&hellip;&hellip; P(5) <td>Suppose
				for Contradiction Subproof
			<tr><td>4 <td>&hellip;&hellip; Q(5) <td> Modus Ponens on
				<span class=box>1</span> and <span class=box>3</span>
			<tr><td>5 <td>&not;P(5) <td>
				Conclusion of Contradiction Subproof from
				<span class=box>2</span> and <span class=box>4</span>
			<tr><td>6 <td><td>
		</table>
		<p>Notice that statement <span class=box>3</span> does <em>not</em>
			follow from the previous statements. The subproof simply supposes
			that it is true to derive a contradiction.
		<p>Because the subproof concludes in <span class=box>5</span>, statement
			<span class=box>6</span> may <em>not</em> reference statements
			<span class=box>3</span> or <span class=box>4</span>.
		<p>Notice that statement <span class=box>4</span> <em>does</em> depend
			on statement <span class=box>3</span>, because it is in the body of
			the subproof. This is what allows a contradiction to be reached.
		<p>The <em>conclusion</em> of the subproof is based on in-scope
			statements, <em>combined</em> with the statement that was used to
			introduce the subproof. The statements explicitly listed in the
			justification are verified to be a contradiction; this fact is used
			with <span class=box>3</span> to produce the conclusion in
			<span class=box>6</span>.

		<h2>
			Verification Example 1 &ndash; Universal Elimination
		</h2>
		<p>Justifications are mostly verified by matching the student's
			statement and the previous statements against different statement
			structures.
		<p>Consider this simple proof involving Universal Elimination
		<table>
			<tr><th colspan=3 style="font-weight: normal;">Ex.:
				Prove that Q(cos(5)+1) is true given that &forall;x, Q(x+1) is
				true.
			<tr><th>#<th>Statement<th>Justification
			<tr><td><span class=box>1</span><td>&forall;x, Q(x + 1)<td>Given
			<tr><td><span class=box>2</span><td>Q(cos(5) + 1)<td>
				Universal Elimination of <span class=box>1</span>
		</table>
		<p>The justification "Universal Elimination of
			<span class=box>1</span> results <span class=box>2</span>"
			needs to be checked.
		<p>First, the statements are parsed and turned into trees of operations.
			(Note that here, there is an explicit function/predicate application
			operator <em>$</em>)
		<figure class=inline>
			<figcaption>Statement <span class=box>1</span></figcaption>
			<ol class=tree>
				<li>&forall;
				<ol>
					<li>x
					<li>$
					<ol>
						<li>Q
						<li>+
						<ol>
							<li>x
							<li>1
						</ol>
					</ol>
				</ol>
			</ol>
		</figure>
		<figure class=inline>
			<figcaption>Statement <span class=box>2</span></figcaption>
			<ol class=tree>
				<li>$
				<ol>
					<li>Q
					<li>+
					<ol>
						<li>$
						<ol>
							<li>cos
							<li>5
						</ol>
						<li>1
					</ol>
				</ol>
			</ol>
		</figure>

		<p>The checker for Universal Elimination begins by matching Statement
			<span class=box>1</span> against a small tree to
			verify that it is a for-all statement.
		<ol class=tree>
			<li>&forall;
			<ol>
				<li><span class=bubble>variable</span>
				<li><span class=bubble>predicate</span>
			</ol>
		</ol>
		<p>When this match succeeds, we get the assignments
		<ul>
			<li><span class=bubble>variable</span> is x
			<li><span class=bubble>predicate</span> is Q(x + 1)
		</ul>

		<p>Next, we want to make a pattern from this to check the student's
			input in Statement <span class=box>2</span>. To do this, all
			instances of <span class=bubble>variable</span> (in this case, just
			<em>x</em>) are substituted with a pattern-matching-variable
			<span class=bubble>instance</span> inside the
			<span class=bubble>predicate</span> tree.
		<p>This yields the pattern
		<ol class=tree>
			<li>$
			<ol>
				<li>Q
				<li>+
				<ol>
					<li><span class=bubble>instance</span>
					<li>1
				</ol>
			</ol>
		</ol>
		<p>The students answer <span class=box>2</span> is matched against this
			pattern, yielding the assignment
		<ul>
			<li><span class=bubble>instance</span> is cos(5)
		</ul>
		<p>Thus, the justification was valid and the statement is justified.

		<h2>
			Verification Example 2 &ndash; Universal Elimination
		</h2>
		<p>Consider the following <strong>incorrect</strong> proof.
		<table>
			<tr><th>#<th>Statement<th>Justification
			<tr><td><span class=box>1</span><td>&forall;x, R(x+1, x+1)<td>Given
			<tr><td><span class=box>2</span><td>R(6+1, 5+1)<td>
				Universal Elimination of <span class=box>1</span>
		</table>
		<p>As in Example 1, first Statement <span class=box>1</span> is verified
			to be a for-all statement. The following pattern is constructed to
			be used to match valid instantiations of it (by substituting all
			appearances of <span class=bubble>variable</span> with a
			pattern-matching variable <span class=bubble>instance</span>)
		<ol class=tree>
			<li>$
			<ol>
				<li>R
				<li>+
				<ol>
					<li><span class=bubble>instance</span>
					<li>1
				</ol>
				<li>+
				<ol>
					<li><span class=bubble>instance</span>
					<li>1
				</ol>
			</ol>
		</ol>
		<p>This is matched against Statement <span class=box>2</span>.
		<p>It establishes the following assignments:
		<ol>
			<li><span class=bubble>instance</span> is 6
			<li><span class=bubble>instance</span> is 5
		</ol>
		<p>Note that the same pattern-matching variable is assigned a value
			<em>twice</em>. Since 5 &ne; 6, the match fails, and the proof
			checker reports
			"Not a valid instantiation of &forall;x, R(x+1, x+1)"
		<hr>
		<p>Consider a similar, <strong>correct</strong> proof:
		<table>
			<tr><th>#<th>Statement<th>Justification
			<tr><td><span class=box>1</span><td>&forall;x, R(x, x)<td>Given
			<tr><td><span class=box>2</span><td>R(2+3, 3+2)<td>
				Universal Elimination of <span class=box>1</span>
		</table>
		<p>This time, the following assignments occur:
		<ol>
			<li><span class=bubble>instance</span> is 2+3
			<li><span class=bubble>instance</span> is 3+2
		</ol>
		<p>Here, when the second assignment is found, it is compared against the
			first one. This comparison can be "smart" and know about the
			commutativity of '+', and thus allow the assignment.
		<p>If an instructor wants to disallow these kinds of 'skipping steps',
			the comparison can be left "dumb" and reject the different form.

		<h2>Verification Example 3 &ndash; Existential Elimination</h2>
		<p>Here is an example proof that uses the Existential Elimination
			subproof.
		<table>
			<tr><th>#<th>Statement<th>Justification
			<tr><td><span class=box>1</span><td>&forall;x, P(x) &rArr; Q(x)<td>
				Given
			<tr><td><span class=box>2</span><td>&exist;y, P(y)<td>Given
			<tr><td><span class=box>3</span><td>&hellip;&hellip;P(c)<td>Suppose
				(for an object called c) from Existential Elimination on
				<span class=box>2</span>
			<tr><td><span class=box>4</span><td>&hellip;&hellip;P(c) &rArr; Q(c)
				<td>Universal
				Elimination of <span class=box>1</span>
			<tr><td><span class=box>5</span><td>&hellip;&hellip;Q(c)<td>
				Modus Ponens on <span class=box>3</span> and
				<span class=box>4</span>
			<tr><td><span class=box>6</span><td>&hellip;&hellip;&exist;y, Q(y)
				<td>Existential Introduction from <span class=box>5</span>
			<tr><td><span class=box>7</span><td>&exist;y, Q(y)
				<td>Conclusion of Existential Elimination subproof from
					<span class=box>6</span>
		</table>
		<p>Note that the kind of statement that can be supposed in a Existential
			Elimination subproof is fairly limited; the name of a constant is
			simply given to a there-exists statement.
		<p>The conclusion can be any statement that does <em>not</em> involve
			the name introduced at the beginning.
